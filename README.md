<h1 align="center">Hi! Welcome to my Github 👋 </h1>

## 🔍  Profile:    
My name is Mariana and I have always worked with market strategies and innovation. During my professional life I've learned that better and more efficient decisions are taken when you have data to support and guide you, and that is why I decided to learn **data analytics**! I enjoy to solve problems, learn new things, and to express my ideas and findings!

## 👀 Here you'll find:
Mainly the exercises and projects I've worked with during my bootcamp on data analytics, and some extra things here and there! A lot of python and data analysis, as expected! 
All of the repos contain a proper readme, don't worry!
